Have you seen people, leaving others alone because they narrated something to them?Something which was very important toward them and quite useless to listener.People who are old and young, and the others, who are also old and young. Breathing, alive!There are dangerous of reading, you better learn this. Reading newspaper, reading books, and blogs like this one.Sometimes, a mis-read from a medical book kills someone. Someone is dead just because someone didn’t read well.Someone ignored something and a living human is no more alive.And, poems! Do you chant poems? Who listens you? The fans! Do they hear your heartbeat too? None or a few…Chant this one and narrate it to yourself everyday to find out how dangerous is reading; reading anything.… Don’t read books! Don’t chant poems! When you read books your eyeballs wither away leaving the bare sockets. When you chant poems your heart leaks out slowly with each word. People say reading books is enjoyable. People say chanting poems is fun. But if your lips constantly make a sound like an insect chirping in autumn, you will only turn into a haggard old man. And even if you don’t turn into a haggard old man, it’s annoying for others to have to hear you. It’s so much better to close your eyes, sit in your study, lower the curtains, sweep the floor, burn incense. It’s beautiful to listen to the wind, listen to the rain, take a walk when you feel energetic, and when you’re tired go to sleep.…Penned by Chinese poet Yang Wan Li in the 12th century, translated by Jonathan Chaves.",

        "content": "Jekyll is my new CMS, a static site generator actually. But, it does work the old Joomla way.You can create standard blog posts using categories, and have permalinks the way you want. My main reasons to switch from Joomla to Jekyll are faster page load, easier content management, and love of going static again.The way we are evolving to live on our planet, one day we’ll destroy it ourselves. That day, (you can say doomsday) there will be nothing but plain texts. I think, then a static website will be much simpler to decode compare to a site which uses dynamic languages and having several databases.So far, I tried to customise minima (standard theme) the way I want to see it. But, I think, I’ll need a template of mine. I better start thinking about this seriously. What was the toughest issue for me? It was a bit time consuming setting disqus. In Jekyll 3.3, disqus comments are enabled by default in production mode. You just need to write your shortname in _config.yml file. Unfortunately, this didn’t work for me due to some sort of logical error.I didn’t have that much time to tinker with the code and needed disqus to work right away, so I simply removed the liquid code from disqus_comments.html file which required disqus to work in production mode.  if page.comments != false and jekyll.environment == \"production\"    if site.url      assign disqus_url = page.url | prepend: site.url        elsif site.github.url      assign disqus_url = page.url | prepend: site.github.url        endif  JEKYLL CODE here    endifAnd, it just worked like charm.Here, I do not recommend offical method of disqus implementation on Jekyll because it would enable disqus on each and every page/post of your Jekyll website. And, each time you will have to write comments: true/false in your YAML front matter to enable and disable it.Now, you have an issue: disqus creates a copy of comments whenever it loads on a page (here in my case, now Jekyll is loading in production environment). To avoid this, just go to your disqus advanced settings and limit disqus code to load on your domain.That’s it. You hacked it!No matter what, you’ll need to tweak a little code of any framework to suit your needs. After all, Jekyll is way better than any other framework to publish websites. I hope, I will spend next one decade with Jekyll.",

I hope, you’ll enjoy it too.…The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly grey, The glory that was Rome is of another day.I’ve been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan, I’m going home to my city by the Bay.I left my heart in San Francisco, High on a hill, it calls to me.To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars, The morning fog may chill the air, I don’t care.My love waits there in San Francisco Above the blue and windy sea,When I come home to you, San Francisco Your golden sun will shine for me.…Enjoyed, didn’t you?

I think, all humans have controversies and secrets. Eenjoy the poem!. . .Come with me then, my son;  Thine eyes are wide for truth: And I will give thee memories,  And thou shalt give me youth.The lake laps in silver,  The streamlet leaps her length: And I will give thee wisdom,  And thou shalt give me strength.The mist is on the moorland, The rain roughs the reed:And I will give thee patience, And thou shalt give me speed.When lightnings lash the skyline Then thou shalt learn thy part:And when the heav’ns are direst, For thee to give me heart.Forthrightness I will teach thee; The vision and the scope;To hold the hand of honour:— And thou shalt give me hope;And when the heav’ns are deepest And stars most bright above;May God then teach thee duty; And thou shalt teach me love.. . .I believe, you enjoyed the warmth of both poet and poem.
